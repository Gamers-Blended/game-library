# game-library

## Installation

`npm create vite@latest`

Framework: React <br>
Variant: JavaScript

`cd game-library`

Install all 3rd party dependencies: <br>
`npm install`

## Creating JSX Components

To convert a gltf/glb file to jsx component:
`npx gltfjsx <path/to/gltf or glb file>`

Generated file will be placed in main directory.

Example: <br>
model named `case.glb` inside public: <br>
`npx gltfjsx public/models/case.glb`

## Development

Runs web server: <br>
`npm run dev`

Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

## Production

Tell Vite to run a production build: <br>
`npx vite build`

When code is ready for production, run: <br>
`npm run build`

Everything used by the application will be compiled, optimized, and copied into the `dist/` folder. <br>
The contents of that folder are ready to be hosted on your website.

To run production build: <br>
`npm run preview`

Visit [http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/)

## Dev Notes

<details>
    <summary>Folder Structure</summary>

- **`node_modules` folder**
  Contains all installed 3rd-party dependencies.
  When Vite builds application, it sees imports for 'three' and pulls three.js files automatically from this folder.
  This folder is used only during development, and shouldn't be uploaded to web hosting provider or committed.

- **`public` folder**
  Contains public assets like images.

- **`index.html`**
  The main page that's served to users.
  `div` with `id="root"` - React will render its components inside this `div`
  `script` tag - Fetches main `jsx` file that serves as entry point for React; `type="module"` - tells browser to treat this file as an ECMAScript module.

- **`main.jsx`**
  Mounts React app (starting with `<App />` component) into the `<div id="root"></div>` element in `index.html`.

- **`package.json`**
  Defines project's dependencies, scripts, and configuration.
  Install the original versions of each dependency by running `npm install`.
  `dependencies` - Packages used in production (e.g. React, ReactDOM, React Router, etc.), required for application to run.
  `devDependencies` - Packages used only for development (e.g. testing libraries, build tools like Webpack or Babel), won't be deployed in application.

- **`package-lock.json`**
  Automatically generated by npm that contains exact versions of all dependencies at the time it was created.
  Used to ensure that all developers are using the same versions of dependencies.
  Do not edit this file manually.
  npm reads `package.json` to determine the required dependencies.
  It then uses `package-lock.json` to install the exact versions of those dependencies.
